Also see: Pi is (still) Wrong: http:\/\/youtu.be\/jG7vhMMXagQ\nPi in Binary Hand Dance: http:\/\/youtu.be\/OCYZTg3jahU\nSpecial thanks to Toby (or not Toby) for playing Dog Hamlet.\n\nThis cool website lets you search the first 200,000,000 digits of Pi. See if your phone number or encoded name is in there! http:\/\/www.angio.net\/pi\/piquery\n\nSeven Sonnets:\n\nAre Shakespeare's plays encoded within Pi? \nThe truth is: we don't know, but we suspect\nThey're somewhere in those digits. And now I\nWill show why we don't know if we're correct.\n\nYou see, we think the digits do behave\nAs if they were a random sequence, and\nSo many mathematicians tried to brave\nThis question, but we still don't understand.\n\nPi isn't random: each digit must be\nExactly what the definition states.\nIt's pseudo-random, far as we can see,\nBut it's the subject of intense debates.\n\nNow I'll explain, with this parameter:\nIt's all in iambic pentameter.\n\nYou may have heard of this scenario:\nA thousand monkeys type at keyboards 'till\nThey write the works of Shakespeare. Even though,\nIn one life it's a task they can't fulfill.\n\nIf you allow their kids to carry on,\nAll through the generations working hard,\nThey will evolve before they come upon\nA single sonnet written by the Bard.\n\nBut still, the theory's sound! And it is true\nThat with a random and infinite set\nOf letters, that eventu-ally you\nWill find whatever words you want to get.\n\nHowever, on this thing you can depend:\nBefore you do, the universe will end.\n\n\nPi is a number, and that's why I can\nCompletely guarantee no part will be\n9-1-3-7-5-2-2-8-ten\n4-7-9-H-A-M-L-E-T.\n\nYou'd have to make up something, like a code\nWhere zero-one is A, Oh-three is C,\nOr you could also choose some other mode,\nOh-2 could be \"to be or not to be.\"\n\nBut let's go with this system, where a Y\nIs 2-5, O's one five, and R's eighteen,\nAnd next comes zero 9 which is an I,\nOh-three, eleven. Yorick's name is seen!\n\nDoes Pi say anything? How does it go?\n1-4-1-5. I guess the answer's \"no.\"\n\n\nIf you desire to search Pi for a thing\nLike Hamlet, as if you'd 'discover' it,\nWithout a copy used for referencing,\nYou wouldn't know if you'd recovered it.\n\nIn fact, it's almost certain, so beware:\nBefore you get to Hamlet, if you slog\nThrough all the digits, you'll find versions where\nThere's just one thing changed: Hamlet is a dog.\n\nDog Hamlet is so awesome and he goes\nOn infinitely many adventures.\nIn this infinite space everyone knows\nDog Hamlet's king. Sometimes he has dentures.\n\nUnless Pi isn't normal. I'll admit:\nPi might not have a single Dog Hamlet.\n\n\nA normal number is a number where,\nIf you take any pattern of length Z\nYou'll definitely find the pattern there,\nAnd others that length, with' same frequency.\n\nLength 1 would just be every digit, so\nAll digits happen infinity times.\nAnd all two-digit numbers also go\nIn there somewhere. If you list all the primes,\n\nYou get the Copeland-Erdos constant, which\nIs one of few known normal numbers. Or\nTake every number in order and stitch\nThem all together. And we know there's more.\n\nMost numbers must be of the normal kind,\nBut somehow they are hard for us to find.\n\n\nWe think that Pi is normal. Also e\nAnd square root 2 and other stuff like that.\nWe don't know how to prove that they must be,\nThat Pi contains Macbeth where he's a cat.\n\nIf you've got every combination of\nDigits of every length, that will include\nA Romeo and Juliet in love\nWho meet in time and live and end the feud.\n\nAnd since the strings of numbers must occur\nWith equal frequency to other strings\nOf the same length, it don't matter whether\nYou choose this code or other permutings.\n\nPerhaps somewhere Dog Hamlet and Catbeth\nAre chillin', bustin' ghosts, avoiding death.\n\n\nThere's simple open problems about pi,\nLike whether every digit, oh through nine,\nKeeps happening. We can't figure out why\n6 shouldn't stop appearing, down the line.\n\nIt seems ridiculous, to think that 2\nOccurs finitely many times.

The history of Mesopotamia, however, is inextricably tied to the greater region, which is comprised of the modern nations of Egypt, Iran, Syria, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, the Gulf states and Turkey. We often refer to this region as the Near or Middle East. \n\n###What's in a Name?\nWhy is this region named this way? What is it in the middle of or near to? It is the proximity of these countries to the West (to Europe) that led this area to be termed \"the near east.\" Ancient Near Eastern Art has long been part of the history of Western art, but history didn't have to be written this way. It is largely because of the West's interests in the Biblcial \"Holy Land\" that ancient Near Eastern materials have been be regarded as part of the Western canon of the history of art.  \n\n###The Land of the Bible\nAn interest in finding the locations of cities mentioned in the Bible (such as Nineveh and Babylon) inspired the original English and French 19th century archaeological expeditions to the Near East. These sites were discovered and their excavations revealed to the world a style of art which had been lost.\n\nAncient Near Eastern art remains popular today; in 2007 a 2.25 inch high, early 3rd millennium limestone sculpture, the Guennol Lioness, was sold for 57.2 million dollars, the second most expensive piece of sculpture sold at that time.\n\n###A Complex History\nThe history of the Ancient Near East is complex and the names of rulers and locations are often difficult to read, pronounce and spell. Moreover, this is a part of the world which today remains remote from the West culturally while political tensions have impeded mutual understanding. However, once you get a handle on the general geography of the area and its history, the art reveals itself as uniquely beautiful, intimate and fascinating in its complexity.  \n\n###Geography and the Growth of Cities\nMesopotamia remains a region of stark geographical contrasts: vast deserts rimmed by rugged mountain ranges, punctuated by lush oases. Flowing through this topography are rivers and it was the irrigation systems that drew off the water from these rivers, specifically in southern Mesopotamia, that provided the support for the very early urban centers here.\n\nThe region lacks stone (for building), precious metals and timber. Historically, it has relied on the long-distance trade of its agricultural products to secure these materials. The large-scale irrigation systems and labor required for extensive farming was managed by a centralized authority. \n\nThe early development of this authority, over large numbers of people in an urban center, is really what distinguishes Mesopotamia and gives it a special position in the history of Western culture. Here, for the first time, thanks to ample food and a strong administrative class, the West develops a very high level of craft specialization and artistic production.\n\nText by Dr. Senta German","url":"","source":"","created":null,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"article","provider":"Khan University","views":null,"children":[]},{"title":"Sumerian Art: Great Lyre from the \"King's Grave\" at Ur","description":"Great Lyre from the \"King's Grave,\" c. 2650-2550 B.C.E., Gold, silver, lapis lazuli, shell, bitumen and wood (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology)\n\nSpeakers: Monica Hahn, Brian Seymour","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZJm7Qgef3ks&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/great-lyre-from-the--king-s-grave---c--2650-2550-b-c-e","created":1332270687,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"9968","children":[]},{"title":"Akkadian Art: Victory Stele of Naram-Sin","description":"Victory Stele of Naram-Sin, Akkadian, pink limestone, 2254-2218 B.C.E.

Western Europe was not a peaceful place during the 600 years after the fall of the Roman Empire. Western Europe (what is now Italy, France, Spain, England, etc.) had been repeatedly invaded. The result was a fractured feudal society with little stability and little economic growth. Charlemagne and the Ottonians had partially and briefly unified the West, and of course the Church was a stabilizing institution, but it was only in the 11th Century that everything changed. Now there was finally enough peace and prosperity to allow for travel and for the widespread construction of large buildings. These were, with rare exceptions, the first large structures to be built in the West since the fall of the Romans so many centuries before. We call the period Romanesque (Roman-like) because the masons of this period looked back to the architecture of ancient Rome. The relative calm of the Romanesque period also meant it was possible to travel, and the faithful set out on pilgrimages in great numbers to visit holy relics in churches across Europe. This meant that ideas and styles also traveled, towns grew and churches were built and enlarged.","created":null,"start":null,"end":null,"provider":"Khan

Many Symbolist belonged to groups of artists who broke away (or seceded) from the art establishment in their respective countries, to hold their own exhibitions.

The British Empire was unmatched with huge territories that stretched across the globe. The Austrian-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires remained intact, and the Italians, Germans, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese retained colonies. Nevertheless, the old order would soon collapse, a result of the Great War in 1914. But this trauma was only the beginning. A global financial collapse precipitated by the stock market crash of 1929 allowed Mussolini, Franco and Hitler to seize power. The violence only worsened with the Holocaust, Japanese Imperial expansion, and the Second World War.\n\nAt the same time, this was a period of radical advances in music (Stravinsky, Bartok, etc.), in dance (Duncan, Graham, etc.) in literature (Joyce, Pound, etc.), science (Einstein, Heisenberg, etc.), and of course, in art (Matisse, Picasso, etc.). In the years between the wars artists explored abstraction and the irrational. After the war, and with Europe in ruins, the focus of the art world shifted from Paris to New York where Abstract Expressionism was born.","created":null,"start":null,"end":null,"provider":"Khan University","needs_enrollment":false,"children":[],"items":[]},{"title":"Expressionism","description":null,"created":null,"start":null,"end":null,"provider":"Khan University","needs_enrollment":false,"children":[],"items":[{"title":null,"description":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7d6S8y2kYSg&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/matisse--luxe--calme-et-volupt---1904","created":1332270791,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"4739","children":[]},{"title":"Matisse, The Red Studio","description":"Henri Matisse, The Red Studio, oil on canvas, 1911 (MoMA)","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W-huWpNU-9w&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/henri-matisse--the-red-studio--1911","created":1332270793,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"6219","children":[]},{"title":"Matisse, Piano Lesson","description":"Henri Matisse, The Piano Lesson, 1916 (The Museum of Modern Art)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vI1kP-9zpw&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/henri-matisse--the-piano-lesson--1916","created":1332270794,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"4154","children":[]},{"title":"Kirchner, Street, Dresden","description":"Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Street, Dresden, oil on canvas, 1908 (MoMA)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Juliana Kreinik, Dr. Steven Zucker, Dr. Beth Harris","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zfZu--psur8&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/ernst-ludwig-kirchner--street--dresden--1908","created":1332270791,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"7352","children":[]},{"title":"Kandinsky, Composition VII","description":"Wassily Kandinsky, Composition VII, oil on canvas, 1913 (State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris, Dr. Juliana Kreinik, Dr. Steven Zucker \n\nhttp:\/\/smarthistory.org\/Kandinsky-CompositionVII.html","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i16sGRY7SZ4&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/wassily-kandinsky--composition-vii--1913","created":1332270792,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"7488","children":[]},{"title":"Jawlensky, Young Girl in a Flowered Hat","description":"Alexej von Jawlensky, Young Girl in a Flowered Hat, 1910, oil on cardboard (Albertina, Vienna)","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vUxYPrznFLw&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/alexej-von-jawlensky--young-girl-in-a-flowered-hat--1910","created":1333785612,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"3462","children":[]},{"title":"Schiele, Seated Male Nude (Self-Portrait)","description":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=croM4PvOdbM&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/egon-schiele--seated-male-nude--self-portrait---1910","created":1333785612,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"2278","children":[]},{"title":"Schiele, Hermits","description":"Egon Schiele, Hermits, 1912, oil on canvas, 71-1\/4 x 71-1\/4 inches (Leopold Museum, Vienna)","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PqRx4OV5jhM&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/egon-schiele--hermits--1912","created":1333785612,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"1669","children":[]}]},{"title":"Cubism and its Impact","description":"The Spaniard Picasso changed the way we see the world.

The vacuum left by European powers as they withdrew from their colonies instigated a global power grab as small nations sought autonomy but became proxies in a global strategic confrontation between Western and Soviet or Chinese ideologies. This resulted in certain instances in the emergence of ruthless dictators, the depopulation of cities, the death of intellectuals, starvation, and civil war.\n\nAt the same time protest movements in the West that called for an end to war, racism, and gender inequality. Powerful, entrenched conservative institutions such as the Catholic Church were transformed, as in the case of The Second Vatican Council. The assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., coupled later with Watergate, created a deep distrust for institutional authority.

With the stated mission \"of providing a high quality education to anyone, anywhere\", the Academy supplies a free online collection of over 2,000 videos on mathematics, history, finance, physics, chemistry, astronomy, and economics.\n\nIn late 2004, Khan began tutoring his cousin in mathematics using Yahoo!'s Doodle notepad. When other relatives and friends sought his tutorial, he decided it would be more practical to distribute the tutorials on YouTube. Their popularity there and the testimonials of appreciative students prompted Khan to quit his job in finance in 2009 and focus on the Academy full-time.\n\nKhan Academy's channel on YouTube http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/khanacademy has 45+ million views so far and it's one of YouTube's most successful academic partners.\n\nIn September 2010, Google announced they would be providing the Khan Academy with $2 million to support the creation of more courses and to enable the Khan Academy to translate their core library into the world's most widely spoken languages, as part of Project 10^100, http:\/\/www.project10tothe100.com\/.\n\nKhan is aiming at making nothing less than \"tens of thousands\" of tutorials offering the \"first free, world-class virtual school where anyone can learn anything.\"","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PhO2gshIVuE&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/authors-google--salman-khan","created":1301529616,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"63367","children":[]},{"title":"LinkedIn Speaker Series  Salman Khan","description":"Salman speaking with LinkedIn CEO and employees on April 15, 2011","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t1F15l7UfqE&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/linkedin-speaker-series--salman-khan","created":1303341983,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"17909","children":[]},{"title":"TEDxSanJoseCA - Salman Khan - (Sequel to talk at TED)","description":"Sequel to Sal's TED talk (TED talk should be watched before this one)","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pRevFhvu8yc&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/tedxsanjoseca---salman-khan----sequel-to-talk-at-ted","created":1304551574,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"33481","children":[]},{"title":"Salman Khan on Big Think","description":"Part of Sal's interview on Big Think","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h8GfMq4-K6g&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/salman-khan-on-big-think","created":1305242825,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"20931","children":[]},{"title":"Salman Khan on Marketplace (NPR) on 5-24-2011","description":"Salman Khan on Marketplace (NPR) on 5-24-2011","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uMjyAp3cs3c&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/salman-khan-on-marketplace--npr--on-5-24-2011","created":1306452429,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"12874","children":[]},{"title":"May 29th, 2011 CNN Piece","description":"Follow up CNN piece to Dan Simon's story on the Khan Academy from last year","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvyAc6PNbVo&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/may-29th--2011-cnn-piece","created":1306970838,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"17259","children":[]},{"title":"Khan Academy on California Report (June 2011)","description":"Khan Academy on California Report (June 2011)","url":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rpPbt8EOf00&feature=youtube_gdata_player","source":"http:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/video\/khan-academy-on-california-report--june-2011","created":1307230035,"start":null,"end":null,"type":"video","provider":"Khan University","views":"10498","children":[]},{"title":"Ideal Math and Science Class Time","description":"A short sample of projects that Sal and Aragon used  alongside the Khan Academy core software and videos.
